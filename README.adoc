== Use Guard and LiveReload

With http://guardgem.org/[Guard] and http://livereload.com/[LiveReload], you can change the content of the doc and have the files automatically generated and your browser updated.

To start, make sure that you have all the needed gems installed:
----
bundle update
----

Then install the http://feedback.livereload.com/knowledgebase/articles/86242-how-do-i-install-and-use-the-browser-extensions-[LiveReload plugin] for your browser (Chrome, Firefox and Safari are supported).

Finally, launch Guard:
----
bundle exec guard
----

Browse to the generated file you want to refresh and activate the LiveReload plugin (don't forget to configure the plugin to accept refreshing local files).
